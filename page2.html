      <p id ="paragraph"> In today's music industry, we are quick to praise
      artists for their songs. However we usually don't give any props to the
    producers, who are responsible for creating most of a song. Sometimes producers
    don't receive pay and get their beats/songs stolen by artists who use it for
    their own personal gain. Addtionally songs are usually
     judged by critics and the public by the "sound" of the song, not the
    content of lyrics. Without good production, an artist won't be able to
    release songs that people would be listening to.
